# Shanghai-University-Course-Selection-Schedule-Plugin
This plugin is designed for the course schedule page of Shanghai University's Academic Affairs System. It intelligently colors the schedule cells based on the weekly information of courses (such as weeks 1-8, 9-16, 1-16, etc.), helping users visually distinguish course arrangements for different time periods.
